# piggame
my first javaScript project(mini)

#about 
this is a project I learned from jonas's udemy course "the complete javaScript".

#description 
this game is based on dice. A player can roll a dice till he gets 2 sixes twice simultaneously or one on a dice.
a player has to hold his score before he gets 2 sixes twice simultaneously or one on a dice. once he holds his score is added and
chance is given to second player. if he didn't hold his score and get 2 sixes twice simultaneously or one on a dice he looses 
his all current score. one who reaches the max score first wins.
